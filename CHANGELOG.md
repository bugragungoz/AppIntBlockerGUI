## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.0] - 2025-07-04
### Added
- **Cancellation Support**: Long-running operations like refreshing firewall rules can now be cancelled by the user.
- **Unit Test Suite**: Created a robust test suite for `FirewallService` using MSTest and Moq to ensure reliability.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Implemented a GitHub Actions workflow to automatically build and test the project on every push and pull request.

### Changed

- **UI Responsiveness**: The loading indicator in the "Manage Rules" view now shows dynamic status text (e.g., "Refreshing rules...").

### Fixed
